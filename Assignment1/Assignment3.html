<p><b><h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLGENCE AND COMPUTING</b></h2></p>
<p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded notfor-profit<br>
     educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and<br>
    Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech<br>
    fields like

            <li> <a href="Assignments/as3.html">Cloud Native Computing</a></li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Block Chain</li>
            <li>Internet Of Thing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cloud Native Computing:</h2>
        <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source<br>
             technologies like<i><b>, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i></b><br>
              while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development<br>
               techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>
               
               <h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
               <p>The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI<br>
                 technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like<b><i> Python, Numpy, Pandas,<br>
                  Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></b> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and<br>
                   ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>

                   <h2>Blockchain</h2>
                   <p>The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum<br>
                     and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on<br>
                      frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps<br>
                     (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice<br>
                      (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token</p>

                      <h2>Internet Of Thing:</h2>
                      <p>The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development<br>
                         technologies like <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,<br> and Kubernetes</i></b> while making them efficient in developing
                          Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT<br>
                          Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p><br>
